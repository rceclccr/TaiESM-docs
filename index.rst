Welcome to the TaiESM documentation pages!
==========================================

TaiESM has been developed since 2008, and has served as a common platform for contributions from the CCliCS Project(Consortium for Climate Change Study), RCEC, Academia sinica and Taiwan Researchers community to the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
These documentation pages provide information about NorESM at key stages of development, as well as recent updates to the model system.
For this reason, separate documentation pages are provided for the different model versions.


Documentation of TaiESM model versions
--------------------------------------

TaiESM versions, similarly to the upstream CESM project, come in two flavors, scientifically supported and validated versions and experimental development versions.
For most use cases, the scientifically supported versions are preferable, being both better tested and documented.


Scientifically supported TaiESM versions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

`TaiESM1 <https://taiesm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm1/>`_ :
   Model version used for CMIP6, IPCC AR5, CMIP7 DCPP and PaceMaker Experiments.
   TaiESM1 is based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2.2).
   The latest code release is `TaiESM1 <https://github.com/rceclccr/TaiESM1/releases/tag/1.0.0>`_, from July. 03, 2017.

Unsupported development versions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
